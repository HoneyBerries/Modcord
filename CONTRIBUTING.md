# Development Guide

This development guide focuses on getting set up quickly and following the project's conventions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ recommended
- A virtual environment (venv, tox, or similar)

## Quickstart

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
   (Use `venv` or `.venv` as you prefer.)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies (do not install the package in editable mode here):**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: the repository's current `requirements.txt` may include an editable install of the package (`-e .`). If you'd like to avoid installing the package in editable mode, either remove or comment out that line from `requirements.txt` before running the command, or install the package separately (see step 4).

3. **Create your `.env` file in the project root with your Discord bot token:**

   ```text
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   ```

4. **(Optional) Install the package non-editably** ‚Äî if you need the package installed (for example to use the `modcord` console script), install it without `-e`:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

5. **Run tests to verify your setup:**

   ```bash
   python -m pytest -q
   ```

6. **Launch the bot locally:**

   ```bash
   python -m modcord
   # or, after installing the package
   modcord
   ```

   Alternatively, use the provided shell script if available and executable:

   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

**Notes:**
- Source code is in `src/modcord/`.
- Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory.
- Never commit secrets or your `.env` file.
- For more advanced configuration, see comments in `README.md` and other docs in the repo.

## Project Layout and Imports

- Source code is under `src/modcord/` and uses absolute imports (e.g., `from modcord.ai import ...`)
- Keep standard-library imports first, third-party second, project-local last

## Running the Bot Locally

- Create a `.env` file in the project root with `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...`
- Start the bot with:
    ```bash
    python -m modcord
    # or, when installed
    modcord
    ```

## Testing

- Unit tests use `pytest`. Prefer running only changed tests where possible.
- Add tests for new features and include both happy-path and a couple of edge cases.

## Code Style and Linting

- Follow PEP8 and generally use black/ruff for formatting/linting.
- Keep function/method sizes reasonable and prefer small modules.

## Releasing and Packaging

- The project uses setuptools (see `setup.py`) and provides a `modcord` console script entry point.

## Local Development Tips

- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` for dependency installation; install the package non-editably with `pip install .` when needed for the console script.
- Keep logs under `logs/`; the logging module rotates files automatically.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` with secrets. Use CI secrets for automated workflows.

## Contact

- For questions about architecture or APIs, open an issue outlining your proposal with enough context for reviewers to reproduce and test locally.
