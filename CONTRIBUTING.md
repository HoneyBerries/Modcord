# Development Guide

This guide will help you get your local development environment set up.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- A virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`)

## Quickstart

1.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`. This will also install the project in editable mode.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Discord bot token:
    ```
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
    ```

4.  **Run Tests**:
    Verify your setup by running the test suite:
    ```bash
    pytest -q
    ```

5.  **Launch the Bot**:
    You can run the bot directly using the module or the installed script.
    ```bash
    # Using the module
    python -m modcord

    # Or using the script (since the project is installed in editable mode)
    modcord
    ```

## Project Layout
- Source code is located in `src/modcord/`.
- All imports should be absolute (e.g., `from modcord.ai import ...`).
- Group imports in the following order: standard library, third-party, project-local.

## Security
- **Never commit secrets**. Your `.env` file is ignored by Git, but always be careful not to expose tokens or keys. Use environment variables or CI secrets for automated workflows.

## Contact
For questions about architecture or APIs, please open an issue with a detailed proposal.
