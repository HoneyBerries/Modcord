  Server Rules
  1. Be Respectful
  Treat everyone with kindness and respect. Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, and personal attacks are not tolerated.

  2. Follow Discord's Terms of Service
  Abide by Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

  3. No Spamming or Flooding
  Avoid spamming, excessive tagging, or flooding chat with messages, links, or unnecessary emojis.

  4. Keep It Safe for Work
  This is a family-friendly server. No NSFW content, graphic material, or inappropriate language is allowed.

  5. Use Channels Appropriately
  Stick to the purpose of each channel. Off-topic discussions should go in the appropriate area.

  6. No excessive Self-Promotion or Advertising
  Self-promotion, including links to other servers, businesses, or social media, is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by staff.

  7. Respect Privacy
  Do not share personal information (yours or others) or screenshots of private messages without consent.

  8. Keep Things Fun and Friendly
  Avoid heated arguments or divisive topics that can ruin the community vibe.

  9. Report Issues to Staff
  If you encounter rule-breaking or issues, report them to a moderator or admin. Don't try to handle it yourself.

  10. Listen to the Staff Team
  Staff decisions are final. Respect their instructions and don't argue about enforcement in public channels.
