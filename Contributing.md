# Development Guide

This development guide focuses on getting set up quickly and following the project's conventions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ recommended
- A virtual environment, perferably venv

## Quickstart

1. **Create and activate a venv:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run unit tests:**
    ```bash
    pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml
    ```

## Project Layout and Imports

- Source code is under `src/modcord/` and uses absolute imports (e.g., `from modcord.foo import foo`)
- Keep standard-library imports first, third-party second, project-local last

## Running the Bot Locally

- Create a `.env` file in the project root with `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...`
- Start the bot with:
    ```bash
    python -m modcord
    ```

## Testing

- Unit tests use `pytest`. Prefer running only changed tests where possible as the tests take quite long to run (15 seconds).
- Add tests for new features and include both happy-path and a couple of edge cases.

## Code Style and Linting

- Follow PEP8 and generally use black/ruff for formatting/linting.
- Keep function/method sizes reasonable and prefer small modules.

## Releasing and Packaging

- The project uses setuptools; `setup.py` is present for building sdist/wheel, so please don't delete it.

## Local Development Tips

- Use 'config/app_config.yml' to your advantage. You can configure GPU VRAM usage as well as many parameters which affect the AI responses.
- If a unit test is failing because you changed stuff, you can modify the unit tests to use the new version of your code.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` with secrets. Use CI secrets for automated workflows.

## Contact

- For questions about architecture or APIs, open an issue outlining your proposal with enough context for reviewers to reproduce and test locally.
